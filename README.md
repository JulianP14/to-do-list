# To-Do List.

***To-do List*** is a personal project aimed to get to know React and its framework Next.js more while practising with both.
Inside the app you will be able to write, update as well as delete any task you want. 
Also any task you type in will be stored locally, so you will not have to worry about not reloading nor closing your browser. The task(s) will be there waiting for you.

## Getting Started.
First, clone the repository:
```
> git clone 'https://github.com/JulianP14/to-do-list'

```
Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or

Lastly open the default development server with the browser.
